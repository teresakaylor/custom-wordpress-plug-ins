# 🛠️ Custom WordPress Plugins

A professional collection of open-source, production-ready WordPress plugins developed to solve specific functional needs, enhance user experience, and demonstrate expertise in integrating custom front-end solutions with the WordPress platform.

## 🌟 Skills Demonstrated

This repository showcases my ability to develop, package, and maintain robust solutions using the following core technologies:

* **PHP:** WordPress core interactions, action/filter hooks, security, and back-end logic.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla/ES6):** Front-end interactivity, DOM manipulation, and modern development standards.
* **CSS/SCSS:** Responsive design and modular, maintainable styling.
* **WordPress API:** Correct usage of functions like `wp_enqueue_script`, `add_shortcode`, and plugin activation/deactivation hooks.
